## Features
- use [Projects](https://github.com/umd-fire-coml/example-scrum-project/projects) as the product backlog.
- use [Issues](https://github.com/umd-fire-coml/example-scrum-project/issues) for each ongoing backlog task.
- use [Branches](https://github.com/umd-fire-coml/example-scrum-project/branches) to implement each task.
- use [Pull requests](https://github.com/umd-fire-coml/example-scrum-project/pulls) for reviewing and merging each completed task branch.

## Example of Running the code
Start by running `python3 --version` and ensuring it is 3.6 or higher. \
Ensure you have the following libaries installed by running `pip freeze`
1) [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py)
2) [Beautiful Soup](https://github.com/waylan/beautifulsoup)
3) [Six](https://pypi.org/project/six/)
4) [Rickroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
5) [Numpy](https://numpy.org)
6) [Cython](https://github.com/cython/cython)
7) [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja)\
Next, clone the code though the following commands 
```bash
mkdir ~/src
cd ~/src
echo "dont actually do this"
git clone git@github.com:umd-fire-coml/example-scrum-project.git
cd example-scrum-project
sudo chmod 446 README.MD 
```
## Progress Table
### This is a sample demonstration of a table
This also demonstrates how aligning works, and also how emojis work. You can embed images in tables too.
